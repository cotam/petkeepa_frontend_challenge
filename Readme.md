##PETKEEPA FRONTEND CHALLENGE

Hi Cadet!

You have two tasks at hand.

First -- Set up your local sandbox. 

Start by getting the code from petkeepa challenge repository at "https://github.com/cotam/petkeepa_frontend_challenge"

You need to use WAMP server. 

Choose the installation directory for wamp as D:\wamp. You can choose any other installation directory but it will only make setting up the sandbox more hard. But we are game if you want to take that as a challenge too.

Create a database called pet in the wamp server MySQL and then import the pet.sql.

You may face difficulties in it but we would like to gauge your problem solving skills from it. You are allowed to ask questions and we will be happy to give you pointers. Your questions will also help us know your thought process.

Send us a screenshot of the homepage once you have set up your sandbox.

Second task -- Browse to Host Listing and then click on a host. You can see the host services box on the right side. As you scroll down you will see other details of the host. Your task should you choose too accept it would be to make the Services box to also float down with your scroll so that it does not get out of sight.  Please look at https://www.airbnb.com.sg/rooms/5516153 as an example. Also please take care of the web responsiveness. We will check your entry in a laptop, mobile and a ipad/ note 10.1

Once you are done send us your public github repo link where we can see your code at careers@petkeepa.com.

Keep committing your code as you progress in your second task as this will also help in seeing your progress.

Good Luck and Happy Coding!
Team Petkeepa.
